## Like PA, but not
Those part of the FS9/FSX scene know about Project Airbus and their free Airbus models and about TDS and their models. But after feeling tired of the tradeoffs of obscene sums of money that companies like PMDG want and the lack of quality that many free addons possess, I've felt it's time to start something that anyone can contribute to.

## Goals
There are, of course certain goals that this project will set out to attain:
* Quality. 4K textures, high-polygon 3D models, the whole thing.
* Ease. I don't want potential users to drag and drop a version of the product into FSX or P3D and see it not work as intended.
* Performance. Given the first bullet, this may be a lot to ask but it's a must.
* Low VAS Footprint (FSX/P3D). Again, a lot to ask but it's important in a 32-bit environment.
* No man (or woman) left behind. That means support for FSX, P3D, and X-Plane.

## Contributing
Some things need to be said
* I don't want to see names in people's work. This is a community driven project.
* Be organized. There's a project structure for a reason. Don't mess with it.
* Detailed commit summaries. I don't want to see "improved vas usage", I want "Adds recycling system to clear unneeded textures and other data from memory".
* Comment your code. This project will only work so long as everyone knows what everything does. For this reason, commenting code it incredibly important.
